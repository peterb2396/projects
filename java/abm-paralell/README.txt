Abstract Machine by Peter Buonaiuto

NOTE TO GRADER: I recommend purposely messing with some of the files and run them to witness the error detection system!


Please note that the following is included in the official documentation, but I usually create a README as per convention, regardless.




To run the machine, place any .abm files in this folder and run the executable (requires JDK or JRE)

Can alternatively be ran through the terminal by navigating to this folder (abm) and executing         “java -jar abm.jar”

If running by the terminal, you can optionally list .abm files separated by
spaces to only run specific files. Listing no files or running the exec will 
run all .abm files in this folder.



If desired, the program can be compiled through terminal with the following command after navigating to it's containing folder:

javac *.java

And the source code can be directly executed (not through the jar) with java abm.java <files>
