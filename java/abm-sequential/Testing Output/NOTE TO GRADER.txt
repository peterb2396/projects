The Project Description specifically requested that all testing output files be included with the project. This folder contains such requested files, but it should be noted that this is NOT the output source folder where the machine saves it's output. 

The reason for that is if the output is generated here, you would not notice the machine generate it's own output because the files already exist here and would just be overwritten.

I feel it is not a strong idea for the output files to be included with the project, because you, the grader, should run the executable and witness the machine generating the files for yourself so that you know it works.

I have included the files here to satisfy the rubric, but recommend viewing the files generated by the machine as you run it.

All I've done is run the executable once and move those files to this folder.

Thank you,
Peter
